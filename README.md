AIUB UniAssist
A Hybrid RAG-Powered University Information and Course Management System
AIUB UniAssist is a full-stack university information and course management platform designed for American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB). It combines a traditional University Course Enrollment System with an AI-powered Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant.
Overview
The system provides:
- Department management
- Student management
- Course management
- Course enrollment
- REST APIs
- Hybrid RAG-based AI question answering
- AIUB TXT knowledge-base search
The planned next version will introduce user registration, JWT authentication, Student/Teacher/Admin roles, role-based authorization, a student dashboard, and AI integration with live university data.

                                        AI Answer
Design principle: RAG handles university knowledge and policies, while the database handles live student, course, and enrollment information.
UniAssist AI
UniAssist retrieves relevant information from the local AIUB knowledge base before generating an answer.
Example questions:
- What are the admission requirements?
- What is the tuition fee?
- What is the attendance policy?
- What scholarships are available?
- How do I register for a semester?
- What are the graduation requirements?
- What are the academic grading rules?
Hybrid RAG
The project combines two retrieval methods:
Dense Retrieval
BGE-M3 + Qdrant identifies information based on semantic meaning.
Sparse Retrieval
BM25 is useful for exact terms such as course codes, percentages, fees, and policy names.
Reciprocal Rank Fusion
RRF combines the rankings from dense and sparse retrieval to produce a unified result set.

Knowledge Base
The AI assistant uses local TXT documents stored in:
backend/data/documents/
The knowledge base covers areas such as:
- Admission requirements
- Academic standing and grading
- Attendance
- Examination policy
- Programs and courses
- Tuition fees
- Scholarships
- Financial aid
- Graduation requirements
- Faculty
- Office contacts
- Semester registration
- Frequently asked questions
The loader automatically discovers *.txt files, so new documents can be added without changing the loader code.

  "message": "What are the admission requirements?"
}
The response contains the generated answer and relevant source information.
Database Design
Students and courses have a many-to-many relationship through the enrollments table.
Student  1 ─────── * Enrollment * ─────── 1 Course
Departments are related to students and courses.
Department
   ├── Students
   └── Courses
RAG Configuration
Example .env:
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
OPENROUTER_MODEL=your_model
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
QDRANT_COLLECTION=university_documents

EMBEDDING_MODEL=BAAI/bge-m3
MODEL_CACHE_DIR=D:/AI_Models

CHUNK_SIZE=500
CHUNK_OVERLAP=50

DENSE_TOP_K=10
BM25_TOP_K=10
RRF_K=60
FINAL_TOP_K=5

ENABLE_RERANKER=false
Never commit .env or expose the OpenRouter API key in the frontend.
Installation
Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js and npm
- Git
- Qdrant
Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
.env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
Configure .env with the required values.
Qdrant
Qdrant should be running at:
http://localhost:6333
Build the RAG Index
After adding or updating TXT documents:
cd backend
python scripts/rebuild_index.py
The index should be rebuilt when the knowledge base changes, not for every question.
Start Backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Backend:
http://127.0.0.1:8000
Swagger:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
Start Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Open the URL provided by Vite.
AI Grounding
UniAssist should use the supplied university context and avoid inventing university policies, fees, requirements, or academic rules.
If the knowledge base does not contain enough information, the assistant should clearly state that the information is not available in the current knowledge base.
For live student, course, and enrollment information, the database should be treated as the source of truth rather than the LLM.
Context and Memory
RAG provides retrieved context to the LLM for the current question.
Conversation memory is a separate feature and is planned for a future version. Memory should complement, not replace, the RAG knowledge base.
Development Roadmap
Version 1 — Current Foundation
- FastAPI backend
- React frontend
- SQLite and SQLAlchemy
- Department, student, course, and enrollment APIs
- TXT knowledge base

- Student, Teacher, and Admin roles
- Role-based authorization
- Student dashboard
- Course enrollment UI
- Duplicate enrollment prevention
- Teacher and Admin interfaces
Version 3 — AI + Database Integration
- AI question routing
- Database tools for UniAssist
- Personalized student questions
- My Courses / My Enrollments
- Course student queries
- Combined RAG + database questions
Version 4 — Advanced AI
- Conversation context
- Optional memory
- Query rewriting
- Optional reranker
- RAG evaluation
- Retrieval and answer quality measurement
Security
- Never commit API keys or .env
- Keep LLM credentials on the backend
- Validate API requests
- Use JWT for authenticated users
- Apply role-based authorization
- Prevent duplicate enrollments
- Derive student identity from authentication
- Restrict administrative operations
- Do not allow the LLM to fabricate database information
Adding New Knowledge
Add a new TXT file to:
backend/data/documents/
For example:
AIUB_LIBRARY_POLICY.txt
AIUB_TRANSPORT_POLICY.txt
AIUB_CLUB_POLICY.txt
Then rebuild the index:
python scripts/rebuild_index.py
